# Harpejji
Virtual harpejji using karplus-strong string algorithm

Implementation of a 16 string harpejji (see http://www.marcodi.com) using a modified version of https://github.com/mrahtz/javascript-karplus-strong for sound generation. The modifications are mainly around making the various classes/funtions exportable (though I did make some changes as far as string handling and dealing with some of the magic numbers used). All credit for the sound generation part goes to Andr√© Michelle (for the original implementation) and Matthew Rahtz (for the JavaScript port).

## TODO
* Make the interface look more like an actual harpejji (eg, http://www.marcodi.com/harpejji.html) and less like the output of `create-react-app`
* Allow a configurable number of strings (the actual harpejji comes in 12, 16 or 24 string models)
* The legato handling (on individual strings) is a bit weird as the full attack is retriggered. I didn't dive too deeply into the karplus-strong implementation to figure out how to cut part of the attack off. Not having played a real harpejji I'm not not sure how the attack actually gets affected by fret changes on a single string.
* Cleanup the front-end code
